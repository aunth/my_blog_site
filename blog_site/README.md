# Blog site

## Description

This is my blog website implementation. I used the Django framework for development. I didn't really focus on the interface, but even without that, there are a lot of unfinished things and functionality. Maybe in the future I'll revisit it and finish it, but for now it stands as is.

## Usage

To run this project, ensure you have the Django framework installed. You can install it using the following command:
```bash
pip install django
```
After installing Django, you can start the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Contributing
If, for some reason, you decide to help me make this site better, then just create a new branch and make a pool request
